Trial code for camera odometry using Open3D in a python binding.
# Dependencies:
    1. Dataset used: ICL-NUIM RGB-D dataset/Living Room 'lr kt2'
    Link: https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html
    2. Python modules:
      i. Open3D
      ii. Numpy
      iii. Matplotlib
# Build instructions:
  For local machines, replace the path file for data set to your path file.
  Current python environment should include Open3D 0.13.0 and its indirect
  dependencies.
